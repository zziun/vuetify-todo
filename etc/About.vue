    <h1>What is Vuetify?</h1>
    <p>Vuetify is a complete UI framework built on top of Vue.js. The goal of the project is to provide developers with the tools they need to build rich and engaging user experiences. Unlike other frameworks, Vuetify is designed from the ground up to be easy to learn and rewarding to master with hundreds of carefully crafted components from the Material Design specification.</p>
    <h1>Why Vuetify?</h1>
    <p>Since its initial release in 2014, Vue.js has grown to be one of the most popular JavaScript frameworks in the world. One of the reasons for this popularity is the wide use of components which enable developers to create concise modules to be used and re-used throughout their application. UI Libraries are collections of these modules that implement a specific style guideline and provide the necessary tools to build expansive web applications.</p>
    <p>Vuetify is developed exactly according to Material Design specification with every component meticulously crafted to be modular, responsive, and performant. Customize your application with unique and dynamic Layouts and customize the styles of your components using SASS variables.</p>
    <p>Vuetify has a very active development cycle and is patched weekly, responding to community issues and reports at breakneck speed, allowing you to get your hands on bug fixes and enhancements more often. In addition, every major release is accompanied with 18 months of Long-term support for the previous minor version.</p>
    <p>Unlike other frameworks, when you develop with Vuetify, you are never alone. Stuck on a problem?
